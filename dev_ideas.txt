        - Krylov projection
            - Arnoldi (or limited)
            - expm on projected matrix
    - Dense or sparse linear algebra (should be option)

- Problem
    - Problem matrix + irradiation timesteps + reference solution at each step
    - Need to be stored in data file (pytables? pandas?)
    - Even for full matrices, store in ijk format

- Test
    - Combination of solver (including its options) and Problem

- Test runner
    - Runs a/many solvers on a/many problems
    - Creates a test instance for each test
    - Writes to a data file.
    
- Develop Jupyter notebook for visualisation
